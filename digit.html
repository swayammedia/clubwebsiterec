                <p class="about__text">As we started with this analysis we asked ourselves if we would be able to improve the results that were presented in 2014 in the paper Automatic detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in whole slide images with Convolutional Neural Networks by professor Anant Madabhushi. Many years have passed since then and it's very likely that all methods used in the paper have already been changed, so we are trying to improve the results
                    By using this project we can find cancer early and easy and save millions of people's life which brings a sustainable future to our country.</p>
