                <p class="about__text">are you one of those who have a passion for game development and want to start a career in game dev but don't know where to start then don't worry you in the right place this blog will
                    help you understand the basic of Game development i think its enough for the introduction
                    
                    The first question that arises in everyone's head when they want to learn something is "where to start ?"
                    
                    First you have to start learning any one of these two softwares (technically engines)</p>
                    <ul class="about_ul"> 
                        <li>Unity</li>
                        <li>Unreal</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    
                   <p class="p1"> As both engines has their pro and cons it's basically upto you to select which engine you want to learn based on what you want to do with it
                    
                    Unity is an open source software and the user interface of unity is user friendly which makes it easier for beginner to learn Unity is written in C# (if you don't know about C# it is an Programming language
                    developed by Microsoft and it is very similar to C++) because of that c# is needed to use unity to its full extend well there are some other alternatives like java and visual scripting but they are not as
                    effective as C# unity is used only for small projects most of the indie developers use unity to make their game some of the games made in unity are
                    </p>
                    <ul class="about_ul1"> 
                        <li>Ori And The Blind Forest</li>
                        <li>Rust</li>
                        <li>Hearthstone</li>
                    </ul> 
            
                    
                   <p class="p2"> Unreal is a licensed software it is basically used for bigger project and AAA title as mentioned above unreal's user interface is not as user friendly as unity but it is still good though
                    if you want a build a game with a massive world and mesmerizing graphics then unreal is your pick unreal is written in c++ so inorfer got you to use this engine you should learn c++ Unreal is developed
                    by ubisoft so most of their games are made in Unreal engine Some of the games that are made in unreal are</p>
                    <ul class="about_ul2"> 
                        <li>Ark survival evolved</li>
                        <li>Batman: Arkham Asylum</li>
                        <li>Friday the 13th: The Game</li>
                    </ul> 
                    <p class="p3">
                    After deciding which engine you want to learn you must first learn the language associated with it
                    
                    In order to create a game you need assets
                    what are assets ?
                    
                    well let us consider a example if you are making an infinite runner game all the scripts , sprites , prefabs , Fonts , 3D model are referred to as assets
                    but in common term assets usually refers to the graphical elements in the game like the player's sprite and the tree and building around him
                    assets can be brought from the unity assets store or you can make your own using 3D modeling softwares like Blender and Maya well its upto y0u decide whether you want to learn blender or buy assets
                    
                    I think I covered the absolute basics of game development in this blog but do remember that the content in this blog is for those who want to become a game developer and create their own game not
                    for those who want to get into  AAA studio because these two paths are very different so keep it in mind that all I got for you guys now
